# FireWatch

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a fire spread detection system that monitors, identifies, and alerts users about the spread of wildfires. The system is designed to provide timely information to help mitigate the impact of wildfires, especially in areas prone to frequent fire outbreaks, like Los Angeles.

## Project Plan
- **Data Collection:** Gather data from sensors, satellite imagery, and weather APIs to detect potential fire hazards and active fire zones.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Use machine learning algorithms and/or rule-based systems to identify fire spread patterns in real time.
- **Visualization:** Develop a web or mobile interface to display fire spread maps and alerts to users.
- **Alert System:** Integrate notifications through SMS, email, or mobile push notifications for early warnings.
- **Scalability:** Ensure the system can handle large datasets and operate efficiently in real-world scenarios.

By the end of the project, FireWatch will serve as an efficient tool for fire detection and prevention, potentially saving lives, property, and natural resources.
